Specificity

-How could you add weight to the global font definition to win over the classes added by point 3?

element value =0001
class, pseudo-Class, atribute value=0010
id value=0100
Style atrybute value=1000

The universal selector * has no specificity
* {
    font-size: 50px;
}

The modifier "! Important" applied to a style attribute has more specificity

A specificity equal always wins the selector that is defined later in the page


-Imagine there is a declaration like class=”oh-no-inline-styles” style=”background:red”
 and you need to change the background to green without changing the inline style.
 How could you accomplish this?

<article class="class1 class2" >
    123456789
</article>

.Class1{
    background: red;
}
.class1.class2{
    background: green;
}
